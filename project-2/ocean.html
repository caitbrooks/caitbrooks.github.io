    <div id="mycloud"><h1>Clouds</h1> 
        <h2>Tiny droplets of water in the air rise with warm air. As they rise, they get cooler. They combine with other droplets of water to form clouds. Clouds are white because they reflect light from the sun. Gray clouds become so filled with water that they don’t reflect light. Masses of clouds form shadows, which can also cause the clouds to look gray. Cumulus clouds look like fluffy tufts of cotton floating in the sky. Sometimes they might take the shape of a dragon, a turtle or some other creature. You’ll see cumulus clouds on warm, sunny days.</h2>

        <div id="mywave"><h1>Wave</h1>
            <h2>The surface of the Earth’s oceans is in constant motion, moving up and down in the form of waves. Waves form as energy is transferred from molecule to molecule across the surface. It is only the energy that actually moves. However, as waves break across a shore or crash in violent storms, they can be the source for great mixing of an ocean’s water.</h2>

            <h2>Sandcastle construction consists of two main ingredients, sand and water. The design possibilities are endless, seeing as how a lot of it relies on the mixture of imagination and creativity. However, there are generally two types of sandcastles. One form is the "typical" sandcastle, consisting of some kind of base with some kind of tower, or towers, on top. The other form is the "drip" sandcastle, which is a when very wet sand is dripped on top of other wet sand and creates a tower of sand globs.</h2>

    <div id="mycloud" style="display: none"><h1>Clouds</h1> <h2>Tiny droplets of water in the air rise with warm air. As they rise, they get cooler. They combine with other droplets of water to form clouds. Clouds are white because they reflect light from the sun. Gray clouds become so filled with water that they don’t reflect light. Masses of clouds form shadows, which can also cause the clouds to look gray. Cumulus clouds look like fluffy tufts of cotton floating in the sky. Sometimes they might take the shape of a dragon, a turtle or some other creature. You’ll see cumulus clouds on warm, sunny days.</h2>
